# IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION
Overview
This project involves the classification of Iris flower species into three categories: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Using the measurements of the iris flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width), a machine learning model is trained to classify the species of an iris flower.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset, which is included in the sklearn library. It consists of 150 samples with 50 samples from each of the three species. Each sample contains the following features:

1.Sepal Length
2.Sepal Width
3.Petal Length
4.Petal Width

Project Structure
The project repository contains the following files:

iris_classification.py: Main script to train and evaluate the models.
iris_classification.pkl: Pickled file of the best-trained model.
README.md: Description of the project and instructions.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies required for the project.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and model development.
data/: Folder to store the dataset (if needed).
